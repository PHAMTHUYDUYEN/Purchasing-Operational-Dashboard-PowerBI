## **II.DESIGN THINKING APPROACH**
### Stage 1: Empathize
|5W1H|---|
|---|---|
|Who will be viewing this Dashboard?|	Senior managers (CEO, Purchasing Manager, Finance Manager)|
|If we had to choose only one key Stakeholder, who would it be?| Purchasing Manager|

|Why do stakeholders need this Dashboard?| 1. To optimize department performance.<br>2. To develop purchasing plan.|
|How have stakeholders been achieving their goals so far?	|Know the performance <br>--> Find aspect that can be optimized <br>--> Develop Action plan to implement the optimization|

|Empathy Map|---|
|---|---|
|**Thinking and feeling**<br>_What does the stakeholder think and feel?_|	I'm facing pressure from the CEO, but I believe that there're some aspects my deparment did great but some aspects can be optimized too.|
|**Seeing**<br>_What does the stakeholder see?_|	Purchasing Department was claimed of its poor performance.|
|**Saying and doing**<br>_What does the stakeholder say and do?_	|"Which aspect in purchasing process should I optimized?".|
|**Pains**<br>_What are the biggest problems and challenges?_|1. How is the department's overall performance?<br>- Is the product cost optimized?<br>- Is the delivery on time?<br>- Is the product quantity sufficiently purchased? <br>- Is the product supplied meet quality standard?<br>2. If any of the above being No, then where the wrong is? How to fix it via choosing vendor and forecasting purchasing demand?|
|**Gains**<br>_What are the opportunities and benefits?_|	By spotting the unoptimized parts, Purchasing manager can enhance the overall performance of the department.|

### Stage 2: Define Point of View
|Northstar Metric|---|
|---|---|
|What VALUE you want to measure?|Expenditure to have products as inventory (buying, transporting).|
|WHEN the value DELIVERY SUCCESS?|When the product is considered inventory.|
|Northstar Metric Name|Spend|
|WHY do you choose this metric?|Purchasing department activities should be based on spend optimization. The more optimized the spending, the more efficiently capital is used.|

## **IV. INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS**
### 1. Improve PO Accuracy
- Issue: All POs require at least 4 adjustments during the ordering process.
- Recommendation: Implement a review and validation process before finalizing POs to reduce the number of adjustments. Consider additional training or a revised checklist to enhance accuracy and minimize errors during the ordering phase.

### 2. Optimize Pricing
- Issue: Only ~7% of orders have optimized pricing, with the total optimized value being less than 1% of the total purchase value.
- Recommendations:
  - Bulk Purchasing: Explore opportunities for bulk purchases to secure better pricing <br>--> Check detailed proposal in Recommendation #4
  - Strategic Vendor Agreements: Negotiate long-term contracts with key vendors for preferential pricing  <br>--> Check detailed proposal in Recommendation #5
  - Price Comparison: Regularly compare prices from multiple vendors to ensure the most competitive pricing <br>--> Check detailed proposal in Recommendation #5
 
### 3. Address Defective Products
- Issue: Products with reject quantities >1000 or reject rates >5% are problematic and need to be handled.
- Recommendations:
  - Immediate solution: Negotiate with vendors to set acceptable limits for reject rates and quantities. Develop vendor principle agreements to manage and improve quality standards.
  - Long-term solution: Seek additional vendors for products with high defect rates to ensure reliable supply and better quality control.
 
### 4. Optimize Stock Products
- Recommendations:
  - Prioritizing to order items with long lead times and high demand to ensure adequate stock levels.
  - For items with low maximum order quantities, negotiate with vendors to increase MOQ limits, reducing the need for multiple POs.
  - For products with high maximum order quantities, consider purchasing at maximum levels to benefit from volume pricing.
 
### 5. Vendor Management
- Recommendations:
  - Sign principle (strategic) agreements with high-spend vendors to negotiate lower purchase prices.
  - Diversify Vendors: Address the issue of 113 products being sourced from one single vendor by finding additional vendors for these products. This will enable price comparisons and selection of the most cost-effective options.

## **II.DESIGN THINKING APPROACH**
### Stage 1: Empathize
|5W1H|---|
|---|---|
|Who will be viewing this Dashboard?|	Senior managers (CEO, Purchasing Manager, Finance Manager)|
|If we had to choose only one key Stakeholder, who would it be?| Purchasing Manager|
|What problem does this Dashboard solve?	| 1. Purchasing Department Overall Performance<br>2. Forecast upcoming purchasing demand<br>3. Vendor quality assessment|
|Describe the problem in one sentence |	Help purchasing manager to grasp the Department Overall Performance, and Details of inventory, vendor to develop optimized operational strategy.|
|When and where will Stakeholders view this Dashboard?| 1. When review department performance in weekly BOD meeting.<br>2. Daily performance review with team, in team meeting.<br>3. Use personally when developing plans and allocating tasks for team members.|
|Why do stakeholders need this Dashboard?| 1. To optimize department performance.<br>2. To develop purchasing plan.|
|How have stakeholders been achieving their goals so far?	|Know the performance <br>--> Find aspect that can be optimized <br>--> Develop Action plan to implement the optimization|

|Empathy Map|---|
|---|---|
|**Thinking and feeling**<br>_What does the stakeholder think and feel?_|	I'm facing pressure from the CEO, but I believe that there're some aspects my deparment did great but some aspects can be optimized too.|
|**Seeing**<br>_What does the stakeholder see?_|	Purchasing Department was claimed of its poor performance.|
|**Saying and doing**<br>_What does the stakeholder say and do?_	|"Which aspect in purchasing process should I optimized?".|
|**Pains**<br>_What are the biggest problems and challenges?_|1. How is the department's overall performance?<br>- Is the product cost optimized?<br>- Is the delivery on time?<br>- Is the product quantity sufficiently purchased? <br>- Is the product supplied meet quality standard?<br>2. If any of the above being No, then where the wrong is? How to fix it via choosing vendor and forecasting purchasing demand?|
|**Gains**<br>_What are the opportunities and benefits?_|	By spotting the unoptimized parts, Purchasing manager can enhance the overall performance of the department.|

### Stage 2: Define Point of View
|Northstar Metric|---|
|---|---|
|What VALUE you want to measure?|Expenditure to have products as inventory (buying, transporting).|
|WHEN the value DELIVERY SUCCESS?|When the product is considered inventory.|
|Northstar Metric Name|Spend|
|WHY do you choose this metric?|Purchasing department activities should be based on spend optimization. The more optimized the spending, the more efficiently capital is used.|

### **View 1: Overview**
<img width="998" alt="Overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/120a86ce-f5b1-420f-8191-66654719cb50">

➡️Insights:
- **_Low PO Accuracy_**: **_All POs_** require at **_least 4 adjustments_** during the ordering process.
- **_Price not optimized_**: Only **_~7%_** of orders have **_optimized pricing_**, with the **_total optimized value_** being **_<1%_** of the total purchase value.
- **_Defective Products_**: There’re products with **_reject quantities >1000_** (e.g. LL Crankarm) or **_reject rates >5%_** (e.g. Metal Sheet 1), which are problematic and need to be handled.

### **View 2: Inventory Management**
<img width="998" alt="Inventory" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/863c3a55-5bae-4597-a0f5-901e5c97036b">

➡️Insights:
- Help to get the **_overall situation of inventory_**: **_69_** items **_needed to purchase_**. Some items have very **_low maximum order qty_**, some very **_high_**, which can be optimized.

### **View 3: Vendor Management**
<img width="998" alt="Vendor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5a0484b-1acb-4ed9-a284-e2d0a421bc46">

➡️Insights:
- The company **_bought most_** of its products and parts from **_Superior Bicycles_** with **_spending_** being **_4.5 million $_**
- **_113_** products being sourced from **_one single vendor_**

## **IV. INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS**
### 1. Improve PO Accuracy
- _Issue_: All POs require at least 4 adjustments during the ordering process.
- _Recommendation_: Implement a **_review and validation process_** before finalizing POs to reduce the number of adjustments. Consider **_additional training_** or a **_revised checklist_** to enhance accuracy and **_minimize errors_** during the ordering phase.

### 2. Optimize Pricing
- _Issue_: Only ~7% of orders have optimized pricing, with the total optimized value being less than 1% of the total purchase value.
- _Recommendations_:
  - **_Bulk Purchasing_**: Explore opportunities for bulk purchases to secure better pricing <br>--> Check detailed proposal in Recommendation #4
  - **_Strategic Vendor Agreements_**: Negotiate long-term contracts with key vendors for preferential pricing  <br>--> Check detailed proposal in Recommendation #5
  - **_Price Comparison_**: Regularly compare prices from multiple vendors to ensure the most competitive pricing <br>--> Check detailed proposal in Recommendation #5
 
### 3. Address Defective Products
- _Issue_: Products with reject quantities >1000 or reject rates >5% are problematic and need to be handled.
- _Recommendations_:
  - **_Immediate solution_**: Negotiate with vendors to set **_acceptable limits_** for **_reject rates and quantities_**. Develop **_vendor principle agreements_** to manage and improve **_quality standards_**.
  - **_Long-term solution_**: For products with high defect rates, find **_more vendors_** to ensure **_reliable supply_** and better quality control.
 
### 4. Optimize Stock Products
- _Recommendations_:
  - **_Prioritizing_** to order items with **_long lead times_** and **_high demand_** first, to ensure adequate stock levels.
  - For items with **_low maximum order quantities_**, negotiate with vendors to **_increase MOQ limits_**, reducing the need for multiple POs.
  - For products with **_high maximum order quantities_**, consider **_purchasing at maximum_** levels to benefit from **_volume pricing_**.
 
### 5. Vendor Management
- _Recommendations_:
  - Sign principle (strategic) agreements with **_high-spend vendors_** to **_negotiate lower prices_**.
  - **_Diversify Vendors_**: Address the issue of 113 products being sourced from one single vendor by finding additional vendors for these products. This will enable price comparisons and selection of the most cost-effective options.
